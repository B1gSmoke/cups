The many problems of POM.

Apparenlty Maven turns off namspaces, since there are many POMs that will not
parse with namespaces on. I get this error immediately. Someone has cut and
pasted only part of the project element, negleciting to copy the namespace
declaration.

The prefix "xsi" for attribute "xsi:schemaLocation" associated with an element
type "project" is not bound.

There are some POMs that Maven will parse that use HTML entities, so Maven must
tuck these initites into its compiler somehow.
